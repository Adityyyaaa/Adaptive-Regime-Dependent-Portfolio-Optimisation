# Adaptive Regime Portfolio Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of the thesis project:  
**"Regime-Dependent Portfolio Optimization: An Integrated Framework of Statistics, Risk-Parity and Deep Learning"**  

## üìò Abstract

In an era of rapidly shifting market conditions, static portfolio optimization models fall short in capturing structural market transitions. This project introduces a **regime-switching portfolio optimization framework** using **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** to detect market regimes and adaptively rebalance portfolios using a combination of traditional financial models and deep learning approaches.

## üß† Key Features

- **Regime Detection using HMMs**
- **Dynamic Portfolio Switching** based on market regimes
- **Integration of Multiple Portfolio Strategies**:
  - Markowitz Mean-Variance (MVP)
  - Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)
  - Autoencoder-based Deep Learning Optimization
  - Black-Litterman blended with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)

## üìä Methodology Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**: NSE sectoral data (2018‚Äì2022) via Yahoo Finance APIs using `pandas-datareader`.
2. **Static Portfolio Strategies**: Implemented and benchmarked MVP, HRP, and Autoencoder-based methods.
3. **Adaptive Strategy**:
    - Regime identification via HMM
    - Regime-specific portfolio allocation using CVaR/MVP
    - Walk-forward testing approach for rebalancing
4. **Performance Metrics**:
    - Annual Return
    - Annual Volatility
    - Sharpe Ratio
